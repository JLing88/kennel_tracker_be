## Description

This application tracks an animal type day care and boarding center. Its main
goal is to track the reservations the business has going for it. An admin can
add new pet owners (aka the paying customers), their pets, and their vet
information. Employees can then see which animals are checking in and out that 
day, what services they may need while there, what medications and feeding
instructions they have, and more.

This is a student led project with a real-world business application and use.
